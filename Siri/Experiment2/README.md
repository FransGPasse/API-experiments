## 

This project is based on Annyang’s API (read more about this in the “Main” README.md). In our main project, we’ve worked with simple sound outputs taken from conversations. (picture from annyang's website below)

## My project

In this project I’ve experimented with the API, to make it as a simple colour game. The user is exposed to a  button with a sting suggesting an action. Underneath is a picture of a flower. The user speaks the colour of the flower and it changes into a new one. If the wrong colour is stated, nothing will happen.

## What is explored

This simple prototype can be used for educational purposes to teach colors, for kids for an example. Any trigger word can be put into the code and the picture connected to it can be whatever, animals, shapes, etc. 

## What you need to know

Annyang is a pretty simple API to work with. The sceleton that we built our main project on and that I experimented with was easy to ad on code to, to make it as we wated it. What the programmer needs is  the programs stated in the "main README.md and ofcourse a vision, what is going to happen when talking to the API. Download or create you own pictures and put them into the code. Add the trigger words in the stings and run the code. What is imortant to know is that the window needs to be interacted with befor talking to it, like clicking the mouse.

## Contributers

The original code is taken from annyangs website (https://www.talater.com/annyang/). Frans, Yulu and I have then built a project upon that library and examples from the creators Github (https://github.com/TalAter/annyang). I have done a this separate experiment built on the same elements. All pictures is done by me and all design elements as well.
