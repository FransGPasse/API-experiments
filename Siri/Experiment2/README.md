## 

This project is based on Annyang’s API (read more about this in the “Main” README.md). In our main project, we’ve worked with simple sound outputs taken from conversations. (picture from annyang's website below)

## My project

In this experiment I’ve experimented with the API, to make it as a simple colour game. The user is exposed to a  button with a sting suggesting an action. Underneath is a picture of a flower. The user speaks the colour of the flower and it changes into a new one. If the wrong colour is stated, nothing will happen.  This simple prototype can be used for educational purposes to teach colors, for kids for an example.
