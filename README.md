# API House plant Project - Voice Recognition:
 
This API project is connected to another project where we explore communication between a person and a plant. 
Annyang is an API library that uses voice recognition and lets the user control the browser with their voice. 
We have in this project, created a way for the API to respond to the users commands with different sound outputs, making the user in some way feel as if they are in a conversation. The sounds that we used can be found in a conversation between people, all only being one worded.

## What we’re exploring

We used the annyang API in our project to prototype if we could artificially create a form of conversation between a human and a plant. We used annyang because it seemed like it would be fairly easy to alter the code since the source code itself had good documentation and was very small.

With this API we wanted to explore and test what different parameters we could use to evoke different responses from both the human and the “plant”. As input, or in other words what the prototype reacts to, we chose to go with words that had a sentimental value or a certain connotation to them. Words such as “sad”, “angry” or “tired” would trigger a response that sounded emphatic while words like “happy”, “love” and “excited” would trigger noises that sounded excited and jolly.

## Use of Code
Please download all the files and folders in the “main” folder, download Visual Studio Code. Put all document’s files in one folder and open with Visual Studio Code. For easier use, use a live server when running the code in the browser.
