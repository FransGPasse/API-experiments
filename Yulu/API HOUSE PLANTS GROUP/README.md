# API HOUSE PLANT EXPERIMENT FOR GROUP
## Description of the project
### Plant figure 
Browser will react to user's speech and then display relevant voice to it. The website will print out user's words when user would be speaking. Because website needed to be clicked to run "audio.play()" function, webiste suggest a feedforward by displaying a plant picture and texts.

### Chosen example
Chosen example is API from Annyang which allows browser to listen and recognize user's speech.Users are allowed to say whichever they want, and the browser will catch part of the conversation and react accordingly."
### Positive words
If users use positive words such as "happy", the API will catch these words in particular and react witn a happy recording. Browser prints words on display.
### Negative words
If users use negative words such as "sad", the API will catch these words in particular and react with a sad recording. Browser prints words on display.
### Neutral words
If users say other words that do not include positive and negative words we defined in code, the API will display a netural feeling recording. Browser prints words on display.

## Usage of the project
To simulate plant and user conversation, the API allows user to talk freely. This project can be used to push human to continue conversation with plants and understand conversation flow and expressions of human's feelings.
