# Frans' first example and main code

## Use of code
To use this code, all you need to do is download the HTML file called "index.html" and open it in your browser. After interacting with the window to enable sound to be played, start by greeting it. You will then hopefully be able to hold a conversation of sorts with the browser, or in the least get some responses back.

## Reference
For all further instructions of how to use this code, who contributed and why it's useful I refer back to the README.md file for the main code.
