# Color changing background example
This example builds on the same code used in the "Main" folder but uses different keywords as input and different output.

## Use of code
To use this code, all you need to do is download the HTML file called "Experiment 2 - Changing colors" and open it in your browser. After interacting with the window to enable sound to be played, start by uttering your favorite color. If the color is one of the 18 in the code it's going to change the background color to the corresponding one.

## Reference
For all further instructions of how to use this code, who contributed and why it's useful I refer back to the README.md file for the main code.
